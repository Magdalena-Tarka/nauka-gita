        <h1>You Want It Darker</h1>
        <h2>Leonard Cohen</h2>
        <p>If you are the dealer<br>
        I'm out of the game<br>
        If you are the healer it means<br>
        I'm broken and lame<br>
        If thine is the glory then<br>
        Mine must be the shame<br>
        You want it darker<br>
        We kill the flame</p>
        <p>Magnified, sanctified<br>
        Be the holy name<br>
        Feel the fire, crucified<br>
        In the human frame<br>
        A million candles burning<br>
        For the help that never came<br>
        You want it darker</p>
        <p>Hineni, hineni<br>
        I'm ready, My Lord</p>
        <p>There's a lover in the story<br>
        But the story's still the same<br>
        There's a lullaby for suffering<br>
        And a paradox to blame<br>
        But it's written in the scriptures<br>
        And it's not some idol claim<br>
        You want it darker<br>
        We killed the flame</p>
        <p>You're lining up to prisoners<br>
        And the guards are taking him<br>
        I struggle with some demons<br>
        They were middle class and dean<br>
        I didn't know I had permission<br>
        To murder and to mend<br>
        You want it darker</p>
        <p>Hineni, hineni<br>
        I'm ready, My Lord</p>
